*About me*

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher and adjunct lecturer, at the the Department of [Statistics and Actuarial-Financial Mathematics](http://www.actuar.aegean.gr/index.php/en/) of the University of the Aegean. Prior to this, I worked at postdoc positions at the Mathematics Department of [Nazarbayev University](https://nu.edu.kz/) (Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan) with Prof. [Tassos Bountis](https://thalis.math.upatras.gr/~bountis/) and at the Italian [National Research Council](https://www.cnr.it/) (Naples, Italy) with Dr. [Lucia Russo](http://www.irc.cnr.it/istituto/russol) .

I completed my PhD (Thesis title: "Bayesian Methods and Estimation of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems") in the Department of [Statistics and Actuarial-Financial Mathematics](http://www.actuar.aegean.gr/index.php/en/) of the University of the Aegean, under the supervision of Prof. [Spyridon J. Hatjispyros](http://www.samos.aegean.gr/actuar/schatz/index.htm).

Before starting my Ph.D, I received a B.Sc. from the [Mathematics Department](https://math.uoi.gr/) of the University of Ioannina (with a focus on Mathematical Statistics) and a M.Sc. in Statistics and Data Analysis from the Department of Statistics and Actuarial-Financial Mathematics of the University of the Aegean.

My research interests lie in Bayesian Statistics, Nonlinear Dynamical Systems and Statistical Machine Learning.
